            6. Trading recommendations for each market

            - Independent analysis of each market's probability
            - If mutually exclusive: probabilities should sum to ~100% (only one outcome can be true)
            - If not mutually exclusive: each market can be evaluated independently
            - Provide actionable insights for trading decisions
            - Be specific about probability estimates
            
            IMPORTANT: When providing probability predictions, include both the market ticker AND the probability percentage.
            Example format: "KXTHEOPEN-25-DMCC: 15%" or "McCarthy (KXTHEOPEN-25-DMCC): 15% probability"
            
            Format your response clearly with market tickers and probability predictions.
